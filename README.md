# Dotter

Dotter is the first programming language made for better web developement in C# and JS, it is easy to learn (takes 10 - 5min)

## Important
Dotter is BETA for now, and its not completed, so if you're a C# developer and you want to complete it, it is open-source now!

## What is it ?
Dotter is an extension for **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **NodeJS**, **C#**. what that means is, *you can now make websites with HTML CSS and JS* with some C# and NodeJS with it!
\
***Example of Hello world in C# & Dotter:***
```c
main>
   #center
   button>
      color is white
      bgColor is green
      text is Click me
      // And some of the other CSS Dotter propreties...

      // Didnt make that yet
      clickedEvent is csharpFunction is {
         MessageBox.Show("Hello, World!");
      }

      // JS
      clickedEvent is jsFunction is {
         alert("Hello, World!");
      }
   <button
   #endcenter
<main
```

## Where did Dotter stop at?
For now, we can say that Dotter is for designing only, cause i didn't make the CS and JS Functions, but i made its IDE (Integrated Developement Environement) and a preview window (Credits to [CefSharp](https://cefsharp.github.io/))


## What's the Dotter IDE Freatures?
Automatic intelligent tag completion, Syntax highlighting ([Scintilla](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET)) and Options with an HTML CSS JS PHP AJAX (Like Chrome) Preview support, automatic brackets completion, automatic TAB Count (See the source code)

Intelligent bracket (") Completion like VSCode.

## Why did you stop updating/making Dotter?
i was bored cause this project took me too long to make, so this is why i published it on github so there will be people who will continue making it ðŸ™‚

## Info
+ Dotter has no documentation for now :( 

  But i'll post one in this Reposity ASAP.

+ Dotter is Line Sensive.
+ Dotter is just an extension for HTML, CSS, JS but the special thing with it is that you can *directly* mix NodeJS, C# with it.
+ In my Opinion Dotter is good for Noobs to start Coding! (it makes them learn propreties, strings, and some other stuff)
+ Dotter IDE is made in WinForms
